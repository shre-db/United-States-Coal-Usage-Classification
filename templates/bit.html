                <p>
                    Bituminous coal, or black coal, is a type of coal containing a tar-like substance
                    called bitumen or asphalt. Its coloration can be black or sometimes dark brown;
                    often there are well-defined bands of bright and dull material within the seams.
                    It is typically hard but friable. Its quality is ranked higher than lignite and
                    sub-bituminous coal, but lesser than anthracite. It is the most abundant rank of
                    coal, with deposits found around the world, often in rocks of Carboniferous age.
                    Bituminous coal is formed from sub-bituminous coal that is buried deeply enough
                    to be heated to 85 °C (185 °F) or higher.
                </p>

                    Bituminous coal is used primarily for electrical power generation and in the steel
                    industry. Bituminous coal suitable for smelting iron (coking coal or metallurgical coal)
                    must be low in sulfur and phosphorus. It commands a higher price than other grades of
                    bituminous coal (thermal coal) used for heating and power generation.
